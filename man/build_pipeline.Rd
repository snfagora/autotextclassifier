\title{Build a pipeline from creating tuning parameters, search spaces, workflows, 10-fold cross-validation samples to finding the best model from lasso, random forest, XGBoost to fitting the best model from each algorithm to the data}
\usage{
build_pipeline(
  input_data,
  category,
  rec,
  prop_ratio = 0.8,
  metric_choice = "accuracy"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{The data to be trained and tested.}

\item{category}{The target binary category.}

\item{rec}{The recipe (preprocessing steps) that will be applied to the training and test data}

\item{prop_ratio}{The ratio used to split the data. The default value is 0.8}

\item{metric_choice}{The selected metrics for the model evaluation among accuracy, balanced accuracy (bal_accuracy), F-score (f_means), and Area under the ROC curve (roc_auc). The default value is accuracy.}
}
\value{
A list output that contains the best output for lasso, random forest, and XGBoost.
