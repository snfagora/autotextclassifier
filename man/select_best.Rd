\title{Select the best output for each algorithm based on the hyperparameters and 10-fold cross-validation.}
\usage{
select_best(lasso_wf, rand_wf, xg_wf, metric_choice = "accuracy")
}
\arguments{
\item{lasso_wf}{A lasso workflow (including the search space for the model)}

\item{rand_wf}{A random forest workflow (including the search space for the model)}

\item{xg_wf}{An XGBoost workflow (including the search space for the model)}

\item{metric_choice}{The selected metrics for the model evaluation among accuracy, precision, recall, F-score (f_means), and Area under the ROC curve (roc_auc). The default value is accuracy.}
}
\value{
A list output that contains the best model output for lasso, random forest, and XGBoost.
}
